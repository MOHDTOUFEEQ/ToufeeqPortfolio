          <p>
          I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of West London, deeply passionate about web development and full-stack application design. Over the past year, I have gained extensive experience in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. My technical expertise includes modern front-end technologies such as JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, and AJAX, combined with libraries like Redux and GSAP for animations. These tools enable me to craft highly interactive and visually engaging applications.

            On the back end, I specialize in Python and Django for developing robust server-side applications. My projects often involve integrating RESTful APIs and managing databases like MongoDB and MySQL to ensure seamless functionality and scalability. Recent projects include a user-focused salon website and a pizza quality classification system leveraging NLP techniques. These experiences have strengthened my ability to deliver innovative solutions that align with both user and business requirements.
